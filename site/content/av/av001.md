summary: "INNOVATION ’19: NUDGE UNITS\r\n\nNo winks. But Penn ‘nudges, nudges’ clinicians, patients to better decisions.\r\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania has established the first “nudge unit” in a health care system to bring the lessons of behavioral economics to the practice of American health care. The goal is to steer clinicians and patients toward choices that will improve health—and save money.\r\n\nFacebook \r\n\nTwitter \r\n\nLinkedIn \r\n\nEmail\r\n\nJuly 5, 2019\r\n\nTIMOTHY KELLEY\r\n\nSenior Contributing Editor\r\n\n\r\n\nIn recent decades, the burgeoning science of behavioral economics has taught economists what doctors, nurses, and care managers have long known: Faced with a choice, people don’t always do what’s best for them. They go for the easy option instead of the prudent one, or favor immediate pleasure over long-term benefit. But such behavior can be changed, and that fact is fueling a health care innovation that promises to save money while enhancing care. It’s called the “nudge” unit."
