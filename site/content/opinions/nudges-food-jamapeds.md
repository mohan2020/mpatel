summary: >-
  Almost one-third of school-aged children are overweight or obese, a level that has not improved over the past decade. Overweight children are more likely to become overweight adults. Even more concerning is that childhood obesity is associated with higher morbidity and mortality later in life, independent of adult obesity. Interventions to improve diet have been demonstrated to reduce weight and improve metabolic outcomes among children and adolescents. However, adopting and maintaining these healthier habits is challenging, and new strategies are needed.
